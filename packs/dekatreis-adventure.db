After the era known as the Departure of the Demigods, foreseeing chaos to fall over the world without a coherent leader, a child of one of the Demigods rose to power and took control, calling herself “The Queen.” Creating 5 distinct kingdoms–Azor, Akiira, Totara, Sarille, and Dekatreis–The Queen placed princes and princesses in charge to rule autonomously while stepping into the shadows, relying on those who she chose to act.</p><h3>The Current Time</h3><p>Through the years of the Queen’s rule, there have been many conflicts. The kingdoms of Sarille, Dekatreis, and Akiira went to war–ending with the utter destruction of the kingdom of Akiira through magical corruption. The kingdom of Azor split into two, causing the Southern continent to become Azoranthium. The Queen’s necessity to step in to resolve the conflicts yet always too late has lead many to question her authority, but always in whispered breaths.</p><p>All the while, sinister forces attempt to dig their nails into an unstable world, often leaving the citizens of each kingdom to take care of the messes themselves while the Princes and Princesses struggle to maintain power over in a world where their Queen has drifted into silence.</p>","actors":[],"combats":[],"items":[],"journal":[{"_id":"0PBfpOiGfwSwr22o","name":"Guide","folder":"v5xaHMOI0nvdOppu","sort":100000,"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"type":"base","scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"}},"pages":[{"name":"Guide","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Orange = Major Landmarks [#FFA500]</p>\n<p>Yellow = Capital Cities [#FFFF00]</p>\n<p>Green = Non-Capital Cities (Population &gt;5000) [#00FF00]</p>\n<p>Dark Green = Villages (Population &lt;5000) [#03DC8B]</p>\n<p>Blue = Oceans [#4D4DFF]</p>\n<p>Cyan = Lakes [#00FFFF]</p>\n<p>Brown = Mountains [#C16100]</p>"},"_id":"PjLzprQO30elgeRb","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"lZMmCOPpq3QSpsO7":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"_id":"C4vDUpFjRgHqEQKv","name":"Lake Sylvis","folder":"czq10j870JFxkpYU","sort":100000,"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"type":"poi","scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}","location":"Akiira","lZMmCOPpq3QSpsO7":{"notes":""}}},"pages":[{"name":"Lake Sylvis","type":"image","src":"modules/dekatreis/assets/images/poi.png","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"_id":"DZCbtHBI5MPXj6xV","image":{},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"lZMmCOPpq3QSpsO7":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"_id":"8R64laL8S27RIFni","name":"The Grand Arena","folder":"kEGlSxA9cTalpCv1","sort":0,"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"type":"poi","scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"}},"pages":[{"name":"The Grand Arena","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a>\n<p>While many demigod artefacts have been hidden away, the one that maintains prevalence in daily society is the Book of Creation. Rosalia Azorblood III, during her long rule, had tracked down the infamous book that had the ability to create a living creature with a soul of any type. She could create life from nothing. However, knowing its abuse would cause mass hysteria, she instead began to host a bi-yearly game: The Grand Arena.</p>\n<p>Every two years, the Princess of Azor would ask for people all across the world to register to fight in the arena. Hundreds of thousands would apply, but only the most skilled and luckiest thousand would be accepted to participate in a grand-scale multi-attributed tournament to prove their worth against all the other competitors. Whether in teams or going in solo, the potential prize was worth the risk of death, which was assured should one lose enough times.</p>\n<p>The prize itself: One use of the Book of Creation, the ability to create any creature that they wished, with almost no limits. The limits, however, were not from the book but from Princess Rosalia herself, to ensure that no one destroyed the world. Besides that, throughout the years, she watched many adventurers battle each other, spill blood and gore, only to reach the end and ask for a variety of things. A re-creation of their loved ones who passed away, a Kathari to keep as a slave, a Mindflayer to study and test on, and even a young Shadow Dragon that would come to be known as an infamous adventurer’s steed.</p>\n<p>When Rosalia III passed on, Rosalia IV picked up the mantle and continued the games, changing almost none of the rules when she saw how much entertainment it brought to the people of her land. It was the one thing that kept turmoil from boiling over into rebellion in the northern continent, and so she did her best never to tread the line when it came to the greatest, bloodiest sporting event of Dekatreis: The Grand Arena.</p>\n</div>"},"_id":"Sp6e5WW56JpftEVD","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"lZMmCOPpq3QSpsO7":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"_id":"VQizOrP4b6Ofispu","name":"Architoutelous","folder":"kEGlSxA9cTalpCv1","sort":0,"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"type":"poi","location":"Azor","lZMmCOPpq3QSpsO7":{"notes":""},"scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"}},"pages":[{"name":"Figure: Architoutelous","type":"image","src":"modules/dekatreis/assets/images/poi.png","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"_id":"WUxLKnnqL7RD8Sre","image":{},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Architoutelous","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>The \"Beginning of the End\" sitting on the North pole of Dekatreis sits the gigantic tree, Architoutelous.

Additionally, with its easy access to the forests to the south, Hero's Reach grew plentifully with hunters, gatherers, druids, and soon an entire city began to form.</p><p>The city's population exploded with a proper, small government forming and introducing trading contracts to get residents the supplies from nearby cities they needed, as well as beginning a massive export program of wood, fish, and meat.</p><p>With such plentiful trade creating an economic fervor around the tip of the peninsula, @UUID[.fD28Wbk2QN39Hki6]{The Docks} were built to properly allow trading ships to be built and boarded, and a lighthouse soon followed after once enough ships had accidentally crashed into the new docks.</p><hr /><h3>Current Government</h3><p>The city's government is comprised of an elected mayor and several representatives from the official guilds around the city. Each mayoral tenure lasts for 6 years, and comes with the full power to oversee the city's trading contracts and propose votes for new city laws, which then get put on a yearly ballot. If the proposed law passes in two consecutive ballots, it is added to the city's lawbook.</p><p>As part of a condition in order to become an official city guild and have sway within city politics, each of the current representatives are elected every 10 years. Despite the long tenure, a new election may be triggered at the whim of the population, if more than 40% of the current residents of the city write the mayor to remove one of the current acting guild representatives.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Current Mayor</span></strong></span> (<em>as of 949 QY</em>): Morella Sevestra</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Current Guild Representatives</span></strong></span></p><ul><li><p>@UUID[.Oy7nNLO6KSFb3rTB]{Adventurer's Guild}: Fourteen Distant Flames</p></li><li><p>@UUID[.oo3SnmgRm1wJ3UTE]{Fighter's Guild}: Jade Cartwright</p></li><li><p>@UUID[.Z4iEY3NfM00Cy1gt]{Artisan's Guild}: Aradayl Rythian</p></li><li><p>@UUID[.bKQWl1BygSGZL5Ir]{Thief's Guild}: Syralye Sharondalan</p></li><li><p>@UUID[.fCxzQOt2wdq4UamD]{Mage's Guild}: Thelanyn Ratsu'skalyn</p></li></ul><p></p><hr /><h3>Quick Timeline</h3><ul><li><p>The first settlers of the region came and began building housing around the year 806 QY.</p></li><li><p>The city of Hero's Reach was officially founded in the year 824 QY.</p></li></ul>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1250000,"name":"University","type":"text","_id":"3Yc5YP9PnpBS9jhY","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p></p><p></p><h2>Notable Members</h2><ul><li><p>- Current representative to the city council.</p></li></ul><p></p><h2>University Benefit</h2><p>As part of the University, its members will periodically be called upon to do tasks for the school.

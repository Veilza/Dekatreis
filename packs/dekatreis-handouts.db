Every single race was made by her, some were changed in some way, others were invented, and many kept their usual form as they were on Toril. Kavara has much work to do, but over nearly 900 years, she accomplished creating a flourishing ecosystem using her knowledge of nature and the Book of Creation. This also allowed me to normalize pretty much every single race I could think of, from both Toril and any other settings I wished to take ideas from. With the Book of Creation, there was no limit.</p><p>During this phase, I was also able to reason out new races that you’ll find in Dekatreis: The Magia, the Petona, and the Kathari. These are all subraces of humans that were created with the Book of Creation. Curious to see the extent that they could manipulate life, the demigods convinced Kavara to put wings on a human. With enough tweaking, she gave humans flight in the forms of the Petona. Then they wished to put more magic inside a human from birth, like the innate magic of elves. She granted them random boons of magical energy that was attached to their blood, and these were called Magia.</p><p>Then came the question: Could the demigods make their own children? The answer, Kavara came up with, was no. The book told her many things, and one of these things was all the magic that they had abused with their godly artefacts had corrupted their bodies, forcing them to never have children. But, Kavara did offer to create children for the demigods and their spouses. In order to set their children apart from all the other species, she would combine what she had done with the Petona and Magia, and she would combine them into one body, and give features from both parents to make it appear like their own. These, she decided, would be Kathari. Kathari would be the children of demigods who had the full ability to breed more Kathari, and with their powerful blood they would have wings and magic that surpassed the Magia’s and Petona’s capabilities.</p></div><h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>Creation of the Continents</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>Dekatreis quickly ran out of room on the tiny island within the first year. So, of course, another two artefacts helped remedy this. Vondal, a dwarf, had an artefact that allowed him to create land from nothing and, while this rose the sea levels, he could raise the land some to balance it all out. With the help of Nasir, who held the Heavenly Robes that allowed him to manipulate the weather before things turned chaotic from the sudden change in sea level and land mass, Vondal was able to create the continents until the demigods were happy. To add in variety, Loriella, a gnome, also helped re-shape the lands, adding in deserts, arctic areas, forests, and more–all using her own artefact, the Talisman of True Transmutation.</p></div><h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>Society Develops</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>After plenty of varieties of creatures were made, and the landmasses were properly designed, the only thing the demigods had to do was watch over their creation to see how it did. Kavara continued creating new species, all with their own free will but most choosing to worship the demigods as true gods for their ability to create such a vast and amazing world on their own. History books were made detailing all their feats and accomplishments, then it was transferred to digital servers with the help of Cecelia, who wielded a ring that could create any piece of technological equipment so long as she knew how the inner workings worked.</p><p>With the ring, Cecelia was also able to help the people make blueprints of all this technology, explain to them what resources they’d need, how to refine it all. They digitized all this information as well, giving them a running start on the techno-fantasy setting that I wanted to have in this setting. Technology and magic wouldn’t compete, but it would grow together.</p><p>Soon, cities began to spring up and a little bit of order was fashioned, but none of the demigods wished to create governments or help the mortals create them. They thought that would be overstepping boundaries when during the last thousand years, all they wanted to do was watch over and see how their creation did on its own.</p></div><h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>Departure of the Demigods</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>1500 years after the demigods had first stepped foot on the world of Dekatreis, and after seeing how far it had all grown and how far it had left to go, some of the demigods began to speak of leaving the physical aspect of the world. The first to go through with this was Tyrae Valsh, the drow that wielded an artefact called the Apple of Discordia. He stated that ever since the beginning, he wished to reach godhood, and he believed that creating a world would grant him such a right. However, despite a number of drow followers, he didn’t find the divine power he sought through their worship. Thus, he vanished into the realms of the Shadowfell, and was from there never heard from again.</p><p>Across the next 1000 years, the rest of the demigods began to slowly depart for various reasons. Keishara claimed her own layer of the abyss, Loriella and Vondal went back to Faerun to be home together again, and many of the demigods actually ascended to godhood, such as Cecelia, who became the goddess of technology.</p><p>The last one to leave the world was Alethra Stormchild, the wielder of an artefact called the Staff of Pure Order. He had a Kathari child named Viessa, and after hiding away his staff, he told Viessa that she could find it and have rightful claim to all its power if she could retrieve it. If she could not, then he relayed to her his fear that the world might fall into chaos without the demigods on it.</p></div><h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>The Queen's Years Begin</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>Finally, we’re back to the Queen, Viessa Stormchild. After going on a long string of adventures searching for her father’s Staff of Pure Order, she eventually reached it and felt its power in her grasp. Immediately, she knew what the artefact could be used for. It had two abilities:</p><ul><li><p>Order: Your very presence with this staff causes those who can hear or see you to trust you and follow your whim. You may utter a verbal component and any living or nonliving creature that can hear you is forced to believe or follow your utterences to the best of their abilities.</p></li><li><p>Universal Speech: Your voice booms through the head of every living, conscious creature in the material plane of the world. This penetrates magical barriers and anti-magic fields. You may reduce the radius of this effect using a specified range, such as 10 miles, or using a qualifier, such as the entire kingdom of Dekatreis.</p></li></ul><p>The power that this staff had was almost corrupting, and recalling it, she began to realise why she had never seen her father with the staff in hand. However, she heard his last words in her head again, how the world could fall into chaos and tear itself apart without someone to guide it. So, with the power of the staff, she combined its two abilities. She spoke to the entire world at once, and forced them to obey. She ordered that she would be their Queen, and that there would be no resistance to her claim, as she was the child of Alethra Stormchild, and she had a right to bring the world into a new era of order.</p></div><h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>New Order</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>Viessa split the world into five kingdoms: Dekatreis, Sarille, Totara, Azor, and Akiira. She placed princes and princesses in control of each kingdom, and trusted them with maintaining order. To ensure this, she would regularly hold meetings between each of the princes and princesses, send diplomats from her court to check on their people, and she, herself, would go out and walk the streets of the kingdoms to interact with the commoners.</p></div><h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>War of the Five Elves</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>This went well for some years, until the War of the Five Elves began. You see, she put the Sun and Moon Elves–creations from the Book of Creation–in charge of Akiira, she put the Dark Elves in control of Sarille, and she put the Wood and High Elves in charge of Dekatreis. These elf groups made efforts to be interconnected and promised each other to share magical research and discoveries with each other no matter what. However, it all fell apart when word reached Dekatreis that the leader of Sarille had obtained an artefact, and had kept it a secret.</p><p>The Prince of Sarille one day found spies in his tower attempting to gain information on this supposed artefact. In fury, he brought the Dekatrian spies out in front of his tower and executed them both, declaring the pact between the three kingdoms ‘destroyed’ and putting full blame on Dekatreis. Dekatreis quickly declared war on Sarille, and Akiira joined the war shortly later on the side of Dekatreis.</p><p>During this time, the Queen had left her tower on a mission, and so she was unaware as this war waged on between the three middle kingdoms. Dirty tactics were employed by Sarille, as the Prince finally revealed which artefact he had: Discordia’s Apple.</p><p>With Discordia’s Apple, the Prince of Sarille was able to “take a bite out of this regenerative apple and speak a verbal component that is under 25 words. All creatures that hear these words spoken, even by second hand, are compelled to see these words as the truth. If it is a command, they must follow the command to the best of their abilities, becoming otherwise mindless until the attunement to the apple ends.” With this power, the Prince took a bite of the apple and told his men that no one should trust the rulers of Akiira, that the Sun and Moon Elves were simply putting their own territory into a crisis and that they had no right to be in the war in the first place. However, when word reached the ears of the Akiirans, something much more grave happened than just forcing Akiira to step out of the war.</p><p>The common people of Akiira turned on their leaders as the words were spread rapidly across the territory, and not only their leaders, but the Sun and Moon Elf races themselves. Over the course of five years, Akiira was brought into absolute chaos, and the Sun and Moon Elves were slaughtered to near extinction with very few escaping the minds corrupted by Discordia’s Apple.</p><p>With Akiira in shambles, Sarille was able to put all of their focus on fighting their war against Dekatreis, but they were still taking heavier losses than their counterpart. The Prince of Sarille took another bite of the apple, and repeated the same corrupting message to be sent to Dekatreis. Before long, the commoners of Dekatreis began to second guess their leaders as well, but not before the Queen returned and, with fury in her gaze, ordered all the princes and princesses–save for Akiira’s, who had been murdered by their own people–to her court.</p></div><h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>Aftermath of the War</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>After a speedy trial, the Prince of Sarille had his artefact taken from him by force, ending his attunement before the kingdom of Dekatreis fell into as much chaos as Akiira had fallen into. The Queen locked the artefact in her vault, making sure it could not be abused any more. Afterwards, she locked the Prince in a prison below her tower on Queen’s Island, where not a soul heard from him again.</p><p>From there, she surveyed Akiira and realised that there was no saving the kingdom. The chaos it had been put through left the land magically corrupted, with portals to other planes conjuring from nothing and terrifying creatures of twisted forms attacking anything that dared get close to them.</p><p>During Sarille’s war, a foreigner had gained popularity among the non-Dark Elves of Sarille, encouraging them to stage an uprising to end the war. By the time they were about to go through with their plans, however, the Queen had ended the war herself, and now the throne was empty. The foreigner was named Thallan Pesthana, and used her influence to convince the Queen that she would make a good next ruler for the kingdom. Many of the Dark Elves had been excommunicated from society, pushed away due to what the Dark Elf Prince had done. Many began to shame the population with the word “Drow,” harassing them and sometimes using violence until many of the Dark Elves took seclusion in setting up their own cities to hide away from all the hatred the other races had gained for them. Though Dekatreis did not have typical Drow at the time, they were called such until one day the influence of Lolth swept in and she began to corrupt the world’s Dark Elves as well.</p><p> </p><p>For additional reading on the history of the world after the War of the Five Elves, see @UUID[.Ox11ew3xCpkT1u7h]{Modern History}</p></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"gVxGX70lxArmMULn","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Seasons","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>The six seasons of Dekatreis are spread out through the year, beginning with calm weather, transitioning into rainy and storming seasons, and finishing the year with a cold snap.</p><p> </p><h3>Calm Winds</h3><p>Calm Winds include the months of Order and Aura.

The Queen also allowed the faction ruler of Azoranthium to become the Prince of Azoranthium with her blessing. The two kingdoms still hold resentment for each other, and naval battles between the two are not uncommon, but full-out war has not gone on for many years.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>Sarille</h3>\n<div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a>\n<p>Thallan Presthana made good on her promise to oversee the kingdom of Sarille, making many changes throughout her rule. Seeing the gods’ influence as detrimental to the good of the world, she outlawed all worship of anyone but herself, the Queen, and the thirteen demigods. Under these terms, anyone seen to have an amulet to Lathander, or to be openly praying to any other deity, would be thrown in jail until they rejected their worship of those deities.</p>\n<p>Thallan also readily embraced a growing population of undead in her kingdom. She created laws that protected vampires and liches from those that might slay them, as well as making sure that their undead servants–so long as they weren’t harming anyone–could be out in public without fear of being attacked.</p>\n<p>With the help of having the undead in her favour, she sparked fear in the hearts of any who would oppose her, allowing her to enact other laws of totalitarian nature, such as implementing security cameras, under-the-skin chips that are required at birth that would track the movements and health of all individuals, and robotic guardsmen that she had developed to ensure peace across the kingdom’s cities.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>Totara</h3>\n<div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a>\n<p>Totara, the desert kingdom, had always stayed out of trouble with the Queen and its own people. They were very accepting of outsides into their harsh lands, lead by a ruler by the name of Xythian Rarazydin, one of the grandchildren of the Queen herself. Xythian’s moral code throughout his rule had always been to ensure everyone had just enough to survive–and more if they could ever afford it.</p>\n<p>His faith centred around worshiping the Demigods and all the territory in their kingdom. Each grain of sand was precious, each oasis was a blessing, the plants, animals and other beings that could survive–the few that could–were kin and spiritually connected to each other. They all knew they had come from the Book of Creation in some ancestry, leaving Xythian and his tribesmen to feel as if they were all family with all others on the planet.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>Akiira</h3>\n<div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a>\n<p>Akiira was left in ruins after the War of the Five Elves. The absolute genocide of the Sun and Moon Elves that was brought upon the lands from the Apple of Discordia’s usage made their blood mix with the soil. Not only that, but countless other spells were used to try and combat the artefact’s power, to no avail, scarring the land with various powerful magics made out of desperation.</p>\n<p>Today, Akiira is but a chaotic land of anarchy, home to treasure hunters and glory seekers who wish to go into the wilds and overrun towers to retrieve items of old and fight beasts that have become corrupted by the land’s magic. Few have managed to set up a “city” of protection for incoming adventurers. This city, named Kamimagi, became a home to those who dare to challenge the wild lands of Akiira whenever they’re preparing for expeditions. The city is surrounded with an anti-magic wall to prevent the creatures of the corrupted land from attacking the city.</p>\n<p>All must be careful, however, as all the corrupted magical land has made a perfect home for portals to other planes. A common traveler through Akiira might find themselves in the Shadowfell one day, escape back to Akiira, and then get stolen away to the plane of Mechanus before they’re able to leave the once glorious kingdom. The only safe place on Akiira from this is Kamimagi.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>Dekatreis</h3>\n<div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a>\n<p>After the War of the Five Elves, the Queen decided to put one of her children in charge of the land. The first ruler post-war was named Adrian Stormchild. He ruled justly and became responsible to inhabiting much of the mountainous ranges of Dekatreis, finding that they were just as suitable for cities as the forests were. He even moved the capital to where it stands still hundreds of years later.</p>\n<p>After some years of rule, Adrian has his life saved during a battle with a ferocious red dragon by a powerful griffon. The strength and magical power of the beast gained Adrian’s respect tenfold, and in return for saving his life, Adrian pushed into law that griffons were to from thereon be considered sacred animals in the realm of Dekatreis, not to be hunted or attacked unless in self-defense.</p>\n<p>The griffon that saved Adrian then re-found the Dekatrian ruler and declared that his name was Antheia, and that what Adrian did had gathered the powerful griffon’s adoration. As the sacred animals of Dekatreis, Antheia offered the service of griffons should the royalty of Dekatreis ever require protection, which Adrian accepted. In addition, the griffon granted Adrian a boon, a portion of his magic, turning Adrian into the first Griffonblood Sorcerer.</p>\n<p>Adrian’s bloodline from there on gained the name Griffonblood, and the griffons remained royal to the Griffonbloods.</p>\n<p>The current two rulers of Dekatreis are Adrian’s daughters, Rasha and Zella Griffonblood, who seek to push freedom and happiness for their people before anything. They set up an adventuring guild after reports declared that there was not enough work in the kingdom to keep families with a stable income. The adventuring guild was named the “House of Tessera,” and networks were made with help of the princesses to establish guilds in all cities of Dekatreis.</p>\n<p>Along with the House of Tessera, Zella opened the princess’ tower to the public, allowing any and everyone to come bring their issues to the princesses whenever they wished, and the princesses would listen and try to resolve issues as they could. This gained widespread positive opinion and allowed their people to prosper with the ever-evolving help of the princesses.</p>\n</div>"},"_id":"Ox11ew3xCpkT1u7h","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.U9ffTjIQKQQ5cBP3.JournalEntryPage.Ox11ew3xCpkT1u7h"}}},{"name":"Adventure Timeline","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">The Creation Years</span></span></p><p>[KM] Kingmaker - 574 DY</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">The Queen's Years</span></span></p><p>[WotFE] War of the Five Elves - 141 QY</p><p>[TLN] The Long Night - 304 QY</p><p>[EotF] Eclipse of the Fallen - 910 QY</p><p>[AoH] Autumn of Heroes - 949 QY</p><p>[WoD] Wrath of Dragonkind - 967 QY</p><p>[SKT] Storm King's Thunder - 967 QY</p><p>[LMoP] Lost Mines of Phandelver - 990 QY</p><p>[OotA] Out of the Abyss - 991 QY</p><p>[OHT] Of Honour and Tyranny - 999 QY</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"e3x8i4cDHXDdWRcq","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":250000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.sSqxb3KWtSBIgnNw.JournalEntryPage.e3x8i4cDHXDdWRcq"}}},{"sort":0,"name":"Statistics","type":"text","_id":"a06unIizCwFGZY5X","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2>The World of Dekatreis</h2><section class=\"traits-bar\"><p><span class=\"trait\">WORLD</span></p><p><span class=\"trait alignment\">MONARCHY</span></p></section><p>A world that was once nothing more than ocean and sparse islands, that became terraformed and populated by The Original 13, a set of 13 self-proclaimed \"Demigods\" who set out to build their own world from scratch.

In charge were two of the Queen’s sons, Rose and Thorn Azorblood. The beginning years were grand; the resources of North Azor and the closeness to Sarille allowed a quick-paced embrace of technology. A strong relationship rose and allowed them to be second-best in development until the War of the Five Elves, where fear of getting dragged into the war forced the twins to temporarily suspend ties with Sarille.</p><p>From there, tensions began to grind between Rose and Thorn over how to settle unrest in South Azor. The immediate suggestion was to have one move to rule over the sister continent, yet with the distance and Sarrile’s war constricting their supplies necessary for development, neither wished to be the one to take up the risk. This eventually lead to a duel between the two, ending in the accidental death of Thorn at the hands of his sister.</p><p>As word of her brother’s murder spread and more calls of South Azor to be fixed, Rose eventually stepped down and put her daughter, Rosalia II, in charge. Rosalia was assassinated during a violent protest that attacked the tower, and the throne went to her next daughter, Rosalia III, right as the War of the Five Elves ceased.</p><p>The third Princess to rule over the kingdom of Azor, with no other options to settle her kingdom, put her foot down and began to make sweeping changes in every civillian’s life. From the farthest east to the farthest west, she declared that with Sarille’s new government registration technology, she would have every single citizen forcefully registered and kept track of. Security cameras, high-tech doors, and guard constructs were imported in mass now that ties with Sarille could be mended, and total rulership with an iron fist was the absolute for Azor.</p></div><h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>Rosalia Azorblood IV</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>At the age of 435 after ruling for centuries, Rosalia III passed away, and her eldest daughter, Rosalia Azorbook IV, took the throne. Being taught by her mother in dominance and rulership, she kept the strong relationship with Sarille but wavered when it came to controlling her people. In many areas she lightened restrictions, such as requiring facial recognition, until an uprising in South Azor during the year 906 QY called her attention. She received word that her brother, Pavlos Azorblood, had claimed himself as Prince of the newfound kingdom of Azoranthium and separated all ties to Azor. To rebuke this, she acted fast and declared war: The Azorian Empire against the rebel nation of Azoranthium. The name change would be temporary, until they could reunify the lands.</p><p>However, as she re-implimented facial recognition and harsher security to track down those would seek to terrorize and speak out against her, she easily saw she couldn’t win the war. Azoranthium, without her knowledge, had began to create mass fleets of warships that were superior to the ships that she could produce, and Sarille refused to step into another war as Thallan Presthana had promised to not get into another conflict in the years before. Thus, she was alone at a stalemate, knowing she couldn’t properly attack but her defenses were bolstered due to the trade partnership with Sarille.</p><p>Within the same year the war started, the Queen called Rosalia and Pavlos to her court and settled the matter after hearing both sides. Knowing there would truly be nothing agreeable between all parties, she simply did what was best for both lands and announced that Pavlos could maintain his position of Prince of Azoranthium, officially allowing the first new kingdom to the world. She warned that the war would not be re-started without consequences, and left the two siblings to their rulerships on opposite sites of the world.</p><p>Since then, Rosalia has held an intense hatred of her brother and Azoranthium, seeing their progress and relations with Dekatreis as well as Totara as the biggest mistake in her rulership, constantly a reminder that she couldn’t hold up to her mother.</p></div>"},"_id":"IKhDFK8lN7InVhec","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":300000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Statistics","type":"text","_id":"UfMKpzHi6jwQcfXg","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2>The Kingdom of Azor</h2><section class=\"traits-bar\"><p><span class=\"trait\">KINGDOM</span></p><p><span class=\"trait alignment\">MONARCHY</span></p></section><p>A kingdom on the northmost region of the planet, its people are constantly under surveillance and fear of speaking out against the princess or the Queen.

Their ability to tap into the mountain ranges with their keen sight allowed them to uncover natural resources better than all the other kingdoms, building up quick technological and societal advancement in many ways. After being accused of hiding a Demigod artefact away from the other kingdoms and starting the War of the Five Elves by executing a Dekatrian spy, the kingdom began its descent into earning the ire of all those outside Sarille.</p><p>During the imprisonment by the Queen after the royal trial, a new ruler was chosen to rule the once-prosperous Dark Elf land. Many non-Dark Elves of the kingdom had during the war began to rally behind a woman named Thallan Presthana, and the influence over millions of followers enabled to Queen to justly pronounce Thallan as the new Princess of Sarille. After her coronation, Thallan began to rapidly shift the society, enabling its darker attitude rather than shun it. Necromancy was greatly encouraged to do jobs that would usually risk the lives of Sarille’s citizens, enabling mining operations to have much more prosperous endeavors.</p><p>Their already well-built technological infrastructure pushed Thallan to make the first national ID system, and with the help of the kingdom of Azor, she placed facial recognition on every single one of her construct guards and registered everyone who passed through Sarille’s cities into her database. The national ID system, in time, was adopted by other kingdoms, but the facial recognition was scorned by all but Sarille and what would become the Azorian Empire. Not only enabling necromancy and mass surveillance, Thallan pushed for full adoption of necromantic magics in her kingdom to be fully realised as a school of magic. Using the national system, she allowed people to consent to their body’s use after death to supply necromancers with, putting the raising of zombies in a much better light due to people not needing to harvest the corpses of the unwilling.</p></div><h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>Thallan Presthana</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>Thallan gained dominant popularity over the non-Dark Elves of Sarille after coming from Akiira and promising an greater ruler, one that wouldn’t provoke needless battle and would send the whole kingdom into a greater realm of prosperity than they had even before the war. In time, she would reveal that she was born of another plane, and after traversing through the Shadowfell, she ended up learning of Dekatreis through a great being that passed onto her knowledge that would supply her rule. Her charismatic personality and inherent strength allowed her to assert rule over any who would dare question her, though she respected the Queen greatly.</p><p>Using necromantically raised servants for most things in her daily life and encouraging the same throughout all of Sarille, her rule manifests itself as ruthless and tactical, oversurging with wealth and propserity from the monopoly her kingdom has on raw materials. In addition, she has made much of the mineal work done in Sarille supplied by undead and constructs. She maintains support by offering high quality social services funded by the kingdom directly, everything from shelter, medicine, and entertainment, as well as practicing regular public appearances through events and games to give her plenty of direct interaction with her populace.</p><p>Her biggest supporters, however, seem to come from the intelligent undead that are labelled as a protected minority under the Sarille government. From liches to vampires, the bordering kingdoms of Dekatreis and Totara both vocally disagree with the rampant unnatural extensions of people’s lives, even though she readily assures that the undead of her kingdom are “good-natured” and that they are closely regulated.</p><p>In addition, Thallan has plentiful enemies in the forms of worshipers of non-Demigods. A few hundred years after she began ruling, she had laws put into place banning all non-Demigod worship except for herself. Years after that, she also placed into effect a law that forced every school to teach worship of Thallan Presthana as divine-blooded.

Sensing it, Vondal formed the continent that would become Akiira, and Kavara populated the place with all sorts of experimental creatures. From the sun and moon elves, long extinct back on Toril, to the were-beasts and several species of draconics and monstrosities. Magic flowed easily from the Book of Creation, almost enticing its power to the land itself.</p><p>During the rule of the Queen, Akiira was quickly overpopulated by the Sun and Moon Elves first and foremost, and people from other kingdoms migrated there using ships to explore the vast, magically-excited lands for themselves, in awe of how bright and colourful everything seemed. Every flower had life to it greater than anything seen on the other continents, and the people seemed more innately skilled at the arcane and psionic. It rose to become a grand centre of magical research during the Queen’s reign, enticing them to forge a pact between Dekatreis and Sarille to share magical knowledge so that all may benefit. However, this same pact seemed to become their downfall, as upon accusation that Sarille’s prince was hiding an artefact from the other two nations, chaos broke loose.</p><p>The War of the Five Elves showed the raw force of the Akiiran people, easily taking down Sarille’s armies of dark elves with Dekatreis moving in on the other side. The victories for Akiira, however, fell short once the the Apple of Discord was used to corrupt and ravage the minds of the people, enticing them to slay the Sun and Moon elves to absolutely devastate their war efforts. In the end, it was complete genocide of the two races, and by the time the war had come to a close, Akiira had been cursed by its own magic.</p><p>No one seemed safe in the lands. Magical beasts couldn’t think straight, attacking any life that moved. Increased potency of magical chaos in the land allowed such beasts to be granted immense magical abilities to carry out their attacks, and spells could hardly be considered stable either. The Akiiran cities were brought to ruins in little more than a few years, and inhabitance would reduce to only the insane monsters, and the fearless adventurers seeking riches in the destroyed remnants of Akiira.</p></div><h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>Anarchy of Akiira</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>With the genocide of the Sun and Moon Elves, Akiira was left without proper rulers, and it seemed impossible for the Queen to reign in control with the mess that the Apple of Discord had caused. Instead of putting in new rulers to a devastated land, she opened up the region for all kingdoms to use as they wished, declaring no one ruler may claim ownership of land on the territory. It would be open for research, exploration, and adventure, but it wouldn’t be inhibited by politics.</p><p>Even though there is no sole ruler in Akiira, somewhat of a large city formed over hundreds of years as adventurers passed through. The name of the city became New Sylvis, in recognition of the old Akiiran capital that had long ago fallen to chaos. The city is split into four separate areas, and frequently tensions run high against the researchers, the adventurers, and the travelling merchants as chaos threatens to seep past anti-magical fields placed around the city and ruin the inhabitants like it did so many others.</p></div>"},"_id":"Fg21BsV8Cg0lwyEf","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":300000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Statistics","type":"text","_id":"lzzCoTVJltSA5S5p","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2>The Kingdom of Akiira</h2><section class=\"traits-bar\"><p><span class=\"trait\">KINGDOM</span></p><p><span class=\"trait alignment\">ANARCHY</span></p></section><p>A kingdom with no ruler, Akiira was once the beautiful kingdom of Sun and Moon Elves.

The 13 Demigods -","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h4>The Demigods</h4><p>The Original 13, the 13 Demigods that first inhabited this world, are known throughout the world in legends and stories. It's been long enough that some doubt their original existence, but the Queen's reign itself is enough to prove to most people that a powerful force was once on this world and granted her the power that she has today.<br /><br />It's said that the 13 Demigods, who created all the races on this world and shaped the landmasses into what they are today, eventually left the world sometime before the Queen came into power. Some say that they ascended into true godhood, others say that they descended into other planes to find out what they could create next. In any case, it's whispered in children's ears that despite being gone from the world, the Demigods that made the world what it is today are still watching over their creation. Nightly prayers and blessings to the Demigods are common among families and churches, no matter the gods they worship.</p><p>The 13 Demigods are as follows:</p><ul><li>@Compendium[dekatreis.dekatreis-deities.MFGaAvPFQFyjYXKy]{Althera Stormchild}: A human Demigod who held a powerful, mind-altering staff known as the Staff of Pure Order, he was the leader of the Demigods and is worshiped as a peacebringer to the lands, who kept the Demigods' creations contained until he eventually left the world. People commonly pray that one day he may return and bring the land to order once more, in fear that the Queen's lack of attendance to the land is worse than the wild anarchy that fell upon the world before she stepped to the throne.</li><li>@Compendium[dekatreis.dekatreis-deities.ZL59ASvMVjKdoNIq]{Tyrae Valsh}: Tyrae was a dark elf that is known in legends as the tactical one of the 13, and the most dangerous. His nickname became \"Discordia\" because of his artifact, which could chaotically bend people's minds to any words that he uttered. After he left the world, many evil Drow and Liches began to worship him as a God of Dark Magic, assuming he had ascended to godhood. Many good-aligned commoners and churches also worship him, though they see him as a Night-centered deity rather than Dark Magic.</li><li>@Compendium[dekatreis.dekatreis-deities.CoOTKYYt4cpVLkCy]{Bequreil}: Some commoners depict Bequreil as a dark looming figure of death, while others style him as a beaming skeletal figure. In any case, Bequreil appears with a large draconic mask over his face, so no one is sure of his true race, but he is worshiped by many churches and temples that pray to him that the cycle of life and death continues on as intended, for he is known to have held the artifact known as the Mask of Life and Death. The draconic mask is said to have been able to kill a creature that had stayed on this world too long with a simple gaze, or resurrect adventurers who had prematurely come to their end, allowing them to continue on in this world until they were supposed to fall.</li><li>@Compendium[dekatreis.dekatreis-deities.jFH1vbRGvBBDqCvk]{Kavara}: Known as the Dragonborn Demigod who is responsible for having a hand in creating all the races, from the simple animals, to the humankind, to the great dragons of the mountains, Kavara the Creator held a book that is said to have been able to create any form of life that she wished. If she uttered the word, it would be created in front of her, and she would give it sentience. Though seen as overly expressive and harsh at times, she wished nothing more than to see the world do well and to create something amazing. She is worshiped throughout all the lands, especially by the dragons in the mountains, and she is mainly responsible for the peace between the dragons and humans having lasted so long. Every time a conflict arises, Kavara's legend is brought to mind, and matters are discussed without violence.</li><li>@Compendium[dekatreis.dekatreis-deities.yE7kX9uFHas3yFTv]{Vondal} and @Compendium[dekatreis.dekatreis-deities.F5Oi4sT2R36KpGxZ]{Loriella}: A pair that never separated, Vondal is depicted as a great Dwarven warrior who could bend the land to his will, creating the landmasses that the world knows today, while Loriella was a Gnomish woman that could transmute one material into another at will. Many stories depict the two using their artifacts in fits of romance, attempting to impress each other with increasingly sizeable creations. Some say that the region that now takes up the mainlands of Dekatreis, Sarille, and the Totara Kingdom was made in this way by Vondal, and at one point, the entirety of Totara's desert was turned into gold for a week by Loriella.</li><li>@Compendium[dekatreis.dekatreis-deities.D0z7Yf9ESc43u2jM]{Rauvel Faemoss}: Known as the \"Angel of Terror,\" Rauvel was widely known for being the biggest threat to the world in its creation days, always 'breaking' the 'toys' that Kavara created. He held the \"Staff of Pure Destruction.\" However, eventually his brother, Nasir Faemoss, locked him away by tricking him to attempt to fight his greatest creation. After being defeated, he bowed and allowed himself to be pushed to the Astral Plane, where he has never been seen since.</li><li>@Compendium[dekatreis.dekatreis-deities.3TzjtytvNSB2s3oh]{Keishara}: A Yuan-Ti pureblood that preferred to keep to herself during the creation of the world, many believed she was evil and associated herself with the other demigods for her own gains. She is the patron of many Yuan-Ti and is sometimes called \"Medusa,\" for her artifact that she wielded allowed her to petrify all beings around her, though in stories it's always said she never claimed to be a Medusa or anywhere near a Gorgon.</li><li>@Compendium[dekatreis.dekatreis-deities.0Sma8mQJVwePWUHZ]{Fyrra Kelrae}: Known as \"The Dispeller,\" she had a terrible hatred of magic and technology, and her artifact reflected this, being the Rapier of Dispelling that could cause a ripple in the weave around herself and break magic. She worked with the other Demigods off the sole reason that she wanted to get away from the magically-influence world from before, and there's rumours she got her wish when she vanished, assumedly to a demiplane where she didn't have to deal with magic anymore.</li><li>@Compendium[dekatreis.dekatreis-deities.MfMlQQaOCoJBHZQ5]{Cecelia}: Cecelia was the Technotheurge, the master of technology and one of the last demigods to leave the world after having helped advance technology faster than in her old world. She wanted nothing more than to help innovate the world forever, but she eventually ascended to godhood, but often assists her priests and worshipers.</li><li>@Compendium[dekatreis.dekatreis-deities.OfjCQTwwfEelXOq6]{Kaylessa}: A beautiful singer that could change the flow of fate with her words and her ocarina, she protected her friends the best she could throughout their adventures, even as they did the dumbest things, and even as Kavara made the most dangerous creations. She banished herself after she couldn't protect Rauvel from Nasir's deception.</li><li>@Compendium[dekatreis.dekatreis-deities.DRzlnNfXkup2ZaVC]{Nasir Faemoss}: The brother of Rauvel, Nasir was also an angel with exceptionally amazing wings. His artifact allowed him to influence the weather at will, protecting their creations from the brutal destruction of hurricanes and volcanoes.</li><li>@UUID[Compendium.dekatreis.dekatreis-deities.1W53gilXCiEydEkm]{Aurae Torran}: The one who began the venture to create their own world. While Alethra was the leader, Aurae had the inspiration and he was the one who could get them to the new world, holding the Amulet of True Teleportation. Stories say he gained his amulet through a bet with Mystra herself, some say that he forged it directly in weave, others say he stumbled upon it. In any case, it's well-known that he was put to shame after losing it in a bet with a mortal.</li></ul><h4><br />Demigod Artifacts</h4><p>Each Demigod had a separate weapon, accessory, or tool that they channeled their power through, known as \"Demigod Artifacts\" today. When the Demigods left the world, some left behind their artifacts, whether they be hidden in ancient temples or lost to time itself. It's known that of the 13, the Queen is known to hold two, and the locations of the rest remain unknown.</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"jd8SpVJcqRysCy49","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":300000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.dekatreis-deities.XusgYsslOitmuHK7.JournalEntryPage.jd8SpVJcqRysCy49"}}},{"name":"- The Court of Sin -","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>General Knowledge</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>Directly opposed to the Court of Virtue, the Court of Sin entangles in the affairs of mortals to attempt to collect the souls of those that become too corrupt to reach the Virtuous Planes.

As such, she gave it to the High Elves and Wood Elves to allow for hundreds of years of prosperity and eager development. Quickly building up a structure to their capital city and welcoming all kinds of races, Dekatreis became a mixing pot for all kinds and enabled many developments that the Dark Elves of Sarille neglected or the Sun and Moon Elves of Akiira rejected.</p><p>After the War of the Five Elves, however, Dekatreis was then given to one of the Queen’s sons who grew particularly ambitious with wanting to help his people in the aftermath of the war. After saving the life of a legendary griffon, his bloodline was blessed with its magic and the griffon became the national symbol of the kingdom, as well as changing the royal name to Griffonblood.</p><p>His twin daughters, Rasha and Zella, were destined to rule the throne together and upon passing, they took on his ideals to help their people but went further than he ever did. Funding an adventurer’s guild named the House of Tessera, they enabled all kinds of people to find work throughout their kingdom, even helping set up locations in the most remote towns so that all of Dekatreis could have the chance to go out and adventure for work rather than be tied to menial tasks that could be better suited to constructs.</p></div><h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>Rasha Griffonblood</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>Rasha is the more prominent of the two Griffonblood Twins. Even though they are together almost always, Rasha takes over a scene with her undeniable grace and authorative voice, not allowing reporters or anyone else to overwhelm her sister. Protective and direct, she assures that when the Princesses promise something will be done, it is given a steady timeline and that it’s seen finished.</p><p>Outside of helping found the House of Tessera, Rasha took it upon herself to also strategically set up trade routes with the Totara Kingdom as well as Azoranthium. Despite earning the ire of Sarille from doing so, the prosperity that came from the sea-specialized Azoranthium and the exports of necessary resources to Totara has enabled the kingdom of Dekatreis to earn a grand amount of wealth that sustains their free social programs such as healthcare and education.</p></div><h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>Zella Griffonblood</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>Though her voice is not heard as often, when she speaks her tone provokes silence over a large majority of her audience. A soothing song flows through each of her words accompanying her understanding and wide-encompassing attenuation to problems of her citizens.</p><p>At her own discretion, Zella has been the focus of making the Princess’ faces known and assuring her populace that they are fitting and caring rulers. Most prominently, the once-restricted doors of the Griffonblood Tower have been opened for public entry for any to come and meet the Princesses and decry their issues. In addition to personal viewing, Zella goes out of her way to allow as many directly forms of transmission from her people to herself as possible so that even the far cities at the ocean’s edge can speak to her.</p></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"GMaWUUhw5GNs183b","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":300000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Statistics","type":"text","_id":"9n2tPkux2kafU4lA","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2>The Kingdom of Dekatreis</h2><section class=\"traits-bar\"><p><span class=\"trait\">KINGDOM</span></p><p><span class=\"trait alignment\">MONARCHY</span></p></section><p>A kingdom of freedom, the people pride themselves on the openness and the cultural mixing pot that Dekatreis has become for all kinds of races due to their extremely accepting attitude.</p><hr /><p><strong>Government</strong> Coregency; two princesses rule over the kingdom</p><p><strong>Population </strong>Humans, elves, dragonborn, kitsune, kobolds, beastkin, tieflings, dwarves, gnomes</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common (Dekatrian), Elvish, Draconic, Giant, Infernal</p><p><strong>Religions</strong> The 13 Demigods, The Court of Virtue, The Court of Sin, The Fates, The Muses, The Forgotten World</p><hr /><p><strong>Threats</strong> Dragons and giants from the mountains, internal conspiracies, cult factions, sea monsters, aberrant horrors</p><hr /><p><strong>Zella Griffonblood</strong> (LG female Kathari bard) A soft-spoken princess that sees over internal public works and programs</p><p><strong>Rasha Griffonblood</strong> (CG female Kathari sorcerer) The more outspoken princess who is forceful and to-the-point, mainly working on projects that involve the other kingdoms and other external issues</p><p><strong>Feylen Tessera</strong> (CG female Tiefling rogue) The standing owner of the House of Tessera, the biggest adventurer's guild in the world that supplies contracts all across the kingdom of Dekatreis</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.8","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1671410124739,"modifiedTime":1674565190363,"lastModifiedBy":"ayc6sPNFNZX4LinZ"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"lZMmCOPpq3QSpsO7":3}}

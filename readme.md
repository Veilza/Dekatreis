# Dekatreis
Dekatreis is a techno-fantasy campaign setting for Pathfinder 2e including a comprehensive world history, seven kingdoms, and many custom deities--including The Original 13, people who rose to demigod status and created the world that this module is named after.

# Kingdoms
In Dekatreis, there are seven kingdoms:
- Dekatreis is a kingdom of freedom and diversity, where the people pride themselves on the openness and the cultural mixing pot that the kingdom has become for all kinds of races due to their extremely accepting attitude.
- Sarille is a necropolis in the truest of definitions. The kingdom is ruled by a vampire, who has made it her mission to expand the rights of necromancers and the undead, allowing Sarille to foster such creatures in plentiful numbers.
- Totara is a desert kingdom built in the sands, once centralised within a singular city near the Wellspring Oasis. Today, Totara is split up into many individual tribes who travel across the sands, with its Prince leading the charge in protecting his people and communicating trade between the tribes and the other kingdoms.
- Azor is kingdom on the northmost region of the planet, and its people are constantly under surveillance and fear of speaking out against the princess or the Queen. The kingdom's people are sated, however, by plentiful events and celebrations, most notable being The Grand Area, where thousands come to spectate the tournaments.
- Azoranthium is a kingdom on the southern pole of the planet, and was once part of the greater kingdom of Azor. Today, it has officially split into its own nation. It has many cities sparsely laid out from one another, but remains to this day a strong source of religious aptitude. Many clerics, oracles and champions find their roots and receive visions here.
- Akiira is a kingdom with no ruler. Once, it was the beautiful kingdom of Sun and Moon Elves. After the War of the Five Elves, and the almost-extinction of both races of Elves, the kingdom devolved into chaos and only the ruins of the kingdom remain, dangerous yet profitable for treasure hunters and researchers.
- Arcadia is a kingdom built on technology and progress from the ruins of Akiira after the War of the Five Elves. The people within the kingdom pride themselves on their betterment of society as a whole and expanding their innovations to the other kingdoms.
